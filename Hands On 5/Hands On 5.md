# Hands On 5 Answers
**1. Implement a min heap data structure. For the parent and left/right functions use bit manipulation operators. In addition your heap should have the following functionality:**

* **The ability to initially build the heap (build_min_heap)**
* **The ability to heapify**
* **The ability to get and remove ("pop") the root node from the heap (and of course re-heapify everything)**
* **The heap should be generic to the type of data (can store floats, int, custom datastructure)**
* **Show example(s) of your heap working. Please demonstrate ALL the functionality you implemented.**
* **Upload your source code to github along with your example(s).**
##
* All the required functionality are displayed in the outputs.
* In the first output, there are all the integers are taken as elements, while in the second output, all the elemetns are in float.

* Output 1
